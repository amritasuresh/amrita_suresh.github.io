# Programmation 1, L3, ENS-Paris-Saclay (2020-2021)

## Exercise sessions
1. [TD1](TD1/TD1.pdf)
This TD covers the basics of different programming paradigms, some introduction to common character encodings, and some information on representation of numbers in the system.

2. [TD2](TD2/TD2.pdf)
This TD focuses primarily on assembler code (x86) and understanding the conversion between C and assembly languages. There will be a bonus TD sheet that covers some missed topics (MIPS code and additional examples).
