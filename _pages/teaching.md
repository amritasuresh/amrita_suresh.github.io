# Programmation 1, L3, ENS-Paris-Saclay (2020-2021)

## Exercise sessions

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

1. [TD1](TD1/TD1.pdf)
This TD covers the basics of different programming paradigms, some introduction to common character encodings, and some information on representation of numbers in the system.

2. [TD2](TD2/TD2.pdf)
This TD focuses primarily on assembler code (x86) and understanding the conversion between C and assembly languages.

3. [TD3](TD3/TD3.pdf)
This TD focuses on MIPS assembly language, some compiler optimizations, and we also begin the study of pointers.

4. [TD4](TD4/TD4.pdf) 
This TD starts with understanding how pointers behave in different languages, then we look at structures and how they are stored in the memory, and finally, we look at string manipulation in C.

5. [TD5](TD5/TD5.pdf) 
This TD deals with static and dynamic binding, along with some examples on call by value, reference, name and need.

SEMANTICS

1. [TD6](TD6/TD6.pdf)
This TD deals with an Introduction to Operational Semantics.
