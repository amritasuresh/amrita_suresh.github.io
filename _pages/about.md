Hello! I am Amrita, a first year doctoral student at the [LSV](http://www.lsv.fr/), [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en). I am broadly working in the field of verification of infinite state systems - more specifically on reachability analysis for underapproximations of asynchronous distributed systems with unbounded buffers. Reach out to me via email or on twitter to know more! 

I am very passionate about theoretical computer science, and I am always up for discussions on interesting problems in the field. Apart from that, I am also a trivia buff, long distance runner, and a chess enthusiast. Of late, I have been into crossword puzzle solving (I am an almost-Thursday level at NYTXW), and one of my goals is to construct a theory-friendly puzzle some time! I also love reading (find me on goodreads!).
