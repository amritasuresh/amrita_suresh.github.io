I am very passionate about theoretical computer science, and I am always up for discussions on interesting problems in the field. Apart from that, I am also a trivia buff, long distance runner, and a chess enthusiast. Of late, I have been into crossword puzzle solving (I am an almost-Thursday level at NYTXW), and one of my goals is to construct a theory-friendly puzzle some time! I also love reading (find me on goodreads!).
